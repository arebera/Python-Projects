What happens when new data comes in?

Ideally, the inital run should load the de-accumulated data into a SQL table.

In that case when new data comes in, the program reads the input, do the required processing and appends the newly de-accumulated data into the previously created SQL table. 

Constraints
The source data should be standardised to match the format in the current csv file with the first column containing the epochs and the second column having the running-total of the measurement. If the data source is a csv file, it should have UTF-8 encoding.
The value should be rounded off to a maximum of 2 decimal places.
